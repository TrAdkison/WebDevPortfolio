<h2>A small list of my favourite movies</h2>
<hr>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings</h3>
<p>Yes, I am counting the trilogy as one movie. This trilogy is what inspired my love of fantasy.</p>
<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>An absolutely beautiful and fun film with plenty of quotable moments. In my opinion, it has a little bit for everyone</p>
<h3>Hot Fuzz</h3>
<p>A surprisingly well written British action comedy starring Simon Pegg and Nick Frost.</p>
